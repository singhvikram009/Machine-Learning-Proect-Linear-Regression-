One of the largest retail chains in the world wants to use their vast data source to build an efficient forecasting model to predict the sales for each SKU in its portfolio at its 76 different stores using historical sales data for the past 3 years on a week-on-week basis. Sales and promotional information is also available for each week - product and store wise.  However, no other information regarding stores and products are available. So we need to forecast accurately the sales values for every such product/SKU-store combination for the next 12 weeks accurately.
